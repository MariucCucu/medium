                    The platform is currently in private beta. It allows users to gauge their carbon footprint, invest in climate solutions, and in turn, provide necessary working capital to SMEs dedicated to improving our planet's future. This funding round includes institutional investment from CV VC and various global business angels.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The fresh funds will be used to finalize the private beta, refine the product for its Q3 MVP launch, and accelerate the mission further. Pyrpose plans to open its seed round soon.
